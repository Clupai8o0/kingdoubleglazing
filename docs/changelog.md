## 2026-04-10 — SEO content depth

- **Sitemap** (`app/sitemap.ts`): Removed hardcoded 5-suburb slug list; now imports `suburbs` from `data/suburbs.ts` and maps all 30 suburb slugs dynamically — previously 25 suburb pages were invisible to Google
- **Suburb testimonials** (`data/testimonials.ts`): Added 18 suburb-specific testimonials for all previously uncovered suburbs (Kew, Malvern, Canterbury, Glen Iris, Doncaster, Box Hill, Burwood, Caulfield, Ringwood, Toorak, Templestowe, Mitcham, Nunawading, Vermont, Wantirna, Wheelers Hill, Mont Albert, Balwyn North); suburb page template already filters by name — all 30 suburb pages now display a suburb-specific testimonial

---

## 2026-04-10 — SEO internal linking completed

- **Pillar → cluster links** (`app/double-glazing/page.tsx`): Added "Double Glazing Topics" section after ComparisonTable linking to all 5 cluster pages (soundproof-windows, energy-efficient-windows, heritage-homes, glass-types, cost)
- **Gallery links from service pages**: Added "See It Installed / Browse the gallery →" strip before CtaBanner on all 6 service pages; category-filtered links for double-glazing (`?category=double-glazing`), shower-screens (`?category=shower-screens`), commercial-glazing (`?category=commercial`), emergency-glass (`?category=repairs`); splashbacks and custom-mirrors link to `/gallery/`
- **Suburb → areas hub back-link** (`app/areas/[suburb]/page.tsx`): Added prominent "← Browse all Melbourne service areas" link at the bottom of the services section (in addition to existing breadcrumb)

---

## 2026-04-09 — Client content: Glass Picker Guide + Modular Retrofit System sections

- **`GlassPickerGuide` section** (`components/sections/GlassPickerGuide.tsx`): Two-path decision tree (Less Heat vs Less Noise) for the glass-types page. Thermal path recommends Low-E → Tinted Low-E with north-facing note. Acoustic path shows Rw comparison table (Standard Clear 35 dB / Standard Laminated 38 dB / Acoustic PVB Laminated 42 dB) and explains the PVB advantage. Each path ends with a direct CTA to the Instant Estimate form. Added to `/double-glazing/glass-types/` before the FAQ.
- **`RetrofitSystem` section** (`components/sections/RetrofitSystem.tsx`): Three-feature block covering the modular retrofit glazing system — wide adjustment range, engineered profiles for most aluminium frames, and custom-machined adapters for unique conditions. Includes a "Custom Capability" callout strip with click-to-call CTA. Added to `/double-glazing/` between BenefitsGrid and GlassOptions.
- Both sections use existing design tokens (`ghost-border`, `primary-container`, `surface-container`, `font-display`, `font-headline`, `rounded-none`).

## 2026-04-09 — SEO critical gaps resolved

- **OG images**: Created `app/opengraph-image.tsx` (root brand OG image via `ImageResponse`) and `app/blog/[slug]/opengraph-image.tsx` (dynamic per-post OG images — imports `blogPosts` directly to avoid edge-runtime `fs` incompatibility)
- **JSON-LD — double-glazing hub**: Added `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` schemas to `app/double-glazing/page.tsx`
- **JSON-LD — cost page**: Added `Service` + `BreadcrumbList` schemas to `app/double-glazing/cost/page.tsx`; FAQ schema emitted by `<FAQ>` component automatically
- **FAQ component schema**: Added `buildFaqSchema` emission to `components/sections/FAQ.tsx`; new `emitSchema` prop (default `true`) prevents double-emission on pages that inject FAQ schema themselves
- **Breadcrumb component**: Created `components/ui/Breadcrumb.tsx` — accessible `<nav>` with `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD emission, `className` prop for spacing, `emitSchema` opt-out; replaced inline breadcrumb in suburb pages
- **NAP**: Set `address.postcode = '3000'` and updated `display` in `data/site.ts` to match Melbourne CBD geo coordinates; street address awaits Tas confirmation

- Category filtering: server-side via `searchParams.category` — no `'use client'` needed; filter links use plain Next.js `<Link>` components
- Post grid: 3-col lg / 2-col md / 1-col mobile; cards show category badge, read time, date, title, excerpt, article link
- JSON-LD: `Blog` schema (with `blogPost` array of `BlogPosting` entries) + `BreadcrumbList`

- Rebuilt `app/instant-estimate/page.tsx` from stub to full page: Hero → TrustBar → ProcessSteps → EstimateForm → FAQ → CtaBanner

  - Step 2: estimate revealed **before** any lead capture — large gold price range + Value Ledger breakdown; optional "Email Me This Estimate" lead form (name + email + phone)
  - Success state after optional form submission
- Created `data/estimate-faq.ts` — 8 FAQ items + `estimateProcessSteps` (3 estimate-specific steps)
- JSON-LD: WebApplication schema + FAQPage schema
- TrustBar: estimate-specific trust items (accuracy, no email required, no sales calls, 10-yr warranty, 90-second result)
- Key UX principle: number is shown first; lead capture is a soft, optional step below — the differentiator vs competitor gated-quote tools
- TODO: wire `handleLeadSubmit` to `/api/estimate-lead` route when backend ready
